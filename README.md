CS 255 Portfolio

Here we are at the end of the class, and looking back at what I have learned, this has been an interesting journey. 

As is required, I need to answer the following questions in a cogent and thoughtful manner. 

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  The DriverPass project was an opportunity, for us as budding developers, to help a company fill a niche in helping people who need a bit for help getting their drivers liscense. The owner recognized the opportunity for groth in the industry, and utilized his skills to create a traing companuy out of nothing. The client was the owenr of the DriverPass company, Liam. The system should be online hosted, to be more available to students to learn and take advantage of on thr road instruction to gdet thier drivers license. 
  I feel like I broke the problem down to reasonable small chunks, which made the process of finguring out how everything should work together much easier. 
  I think, if I were to rework the documents, I probably would spend a but more time withthe business requirements document. I am not sure I  had the best understanding of what that document was supposed to look like. I may have also confused some of the terms, and listed them improperly. 
  I tried to interpret the end users needs and corporate users needs in the program. I wanted to make the student end as user friendly as possible so that they would engage with it easily, without much guidance needed to do the things they wanted to do. At the end of the day, the system is a tool, and so must be fit for use in the intended way. You could have created the greatest program ever, but if all the user facing text is in Russin, and nobody who uses the sysem can read or understand Russin, then the system is a fancy and expensive door stop. Im not sure what happened to the Russians... they just kind of do't come around so much anymore. 
  And my approach to designing software is to utilize a similar system to identify the wants, needs, and requirements for the system to do all the thinge the user wants it to. I would ananlyze all the data I could gather about the project, and sit and digest it for a bit, and then start doing the work for the paperwork and docmentation. I think I will stay with my current processof reading. ananlying, and coding, and documentation for future users, engineers or my future self. 

  Anyway, had a good time with this one...
